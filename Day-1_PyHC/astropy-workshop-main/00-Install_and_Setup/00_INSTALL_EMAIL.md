Dear Astropy Workshop Participants,

We are looking forward to seeing you at the _Using Python and Astropy for Astronomical Data Analysis Workshop_
on January 4, 2020 at the American Astronomical Society meeting!

__Pre-workshop Survey__

Please fill out our survey at https://forms.gle/FUA1Bx17WgDjCKk27 regarding your past experience with astronomical Python as we can better ensure the workshop is tailored to your needs.

__Setup Instructions__
https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop/blob/main/00-Install_and_Setup

Please be sure your laptop is properly configured BEFORE the workshop. The setup could take as long as one hour depending on your current configuration and internet speeds. If you have any trouble, please open an issue in the repo using https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop#problems-or-questions or post a message on the #workshop Slack channel in the Astropy workspace (described below). If on the morning of the workshop, you still have doubts or questions about your laptop setup, please arrive promptly at 9am.

Our facilitators are still working on the content of the workshop notebooks. We are pleased to be able to present features from our new 4.0 release of the astropy core package. We will send one more email just before the workshop with instructions to update to the final version of the notebooks.

__Schedule__

This workshop is sold out and we are anticipating folks to show up who did not pre-register. If you do not arrive by 10:30, your seat may be given away. If you know you're going to be late, please drop me an email.

Continental breakfast will be available from 9-10:30 and there will be snacks and coffee again in the afternoon. Lunch will NOT be provided.
