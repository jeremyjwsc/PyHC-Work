Dear Astropy Workshop Participants,

The workshop begins at 9:00am tomorrow! The room is 301B at the Hawai'i Convention Center (changed
from our previous email).

If you have not yet done so, please follow the setup instructions at

https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop/blob/main/00-Install_and_Setup

If you are having problems, please arrive promptly at 9:00am so we can help you before the presentations
start at 9:30am.

__Updating workshop materials__

Our facilitators are polishing up workshop materials. To update the workshop notebooks, please follow
these instructions:

https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop/blob/main/00-Install_and_Setup/UPDATING.md

It may be necessary to update just before the workshop begins. We expect those changes to be small and
to not take long.

__Schedule__

https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop

This workshop is sold out and we are anticipating folks to show up who did not pre-register. If you do not
arrive by 10:30, your seat may be given away. If you know you're going to be late, please drop me an email.

Continental breakfast will be available from 9-10:30 and there will be snacks and coffee again in the afternoon. Lunch will NOT be provided.
