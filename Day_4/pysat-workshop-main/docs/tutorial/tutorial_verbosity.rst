Verbosity
---------

pysat uses Python's standard
`logging tools <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html>`_
to control the verbosity of output. By default only logger.warning messages
are shown. For more detailed instrument output you may change the
logging level.

.. code:: python

  import logging
  import pysat
  logger.set_level(logging.INFO)

The logging level will be applied to all instruments loaded by pysat.
