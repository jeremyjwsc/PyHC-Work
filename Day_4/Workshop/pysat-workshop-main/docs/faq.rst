Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**Q. Does pysat support data from ... mission?**

A. Possibly!  A full list of supported instruments, models, and scientific
   indices can be found at :ref:`eco-inst`. The status of instruments
   and repositories currently under development can be found on the
   `wiki <https://github.com/pysat/pysat/wiki/Pysat-Ecosystem-Status-Chart>`_.


**Q. Yeah, but what about ...?**

A. If a data set is not in the current list of instruments or on the develop
   branch of one of the repositories, consider contributing to the appropriate
   repository. If no such repository currently exists, you may either do it
   yourself or contact the pysat development team.  You may also create a
   single instrument template and use it locally.  However, contributions are
   very welcome!

   Check out info about :ref:`rst_new_inst` and make sure to read the
   development guidelines in the Contrubiting section.

**Q.  My question isn't listed here :(**

A. Add it to the `wiki FAQ <https://github.com/pysat/pysat/wiki/FAQ>`_, join
   the pysat slack channel, add a *question* issue to the appropriate pysat
   GitHub repository, or email the development team at
   pysat.developers@gmail.com.
