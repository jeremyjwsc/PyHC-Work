Introduction
============

Every scientific instrument has unique properties, though the general process
for science data analysis is platform independent. This process can by described
as: finding and downloading data, writing code to load the data, cleaning the
data to an appropriate level, and applying the specific analysis for a project,
and plotting the results. The Python Satellite Data Analysis Toolkit (pysat)
provides a framework to support this general process that builds upon these
commonalities.  In doing so, pysat simplifies the process of using new
instruments, reduces data management overhead, and enables the creation of
instrument independent analysis routines. Although pysat was initially designed
for `in situ` satellite measurements, pysat has grown to support both
observational and modelled space science measurements.

The newest incarnation of pysat has been pared down to focus on the core
elements of our mission: providing a framework for data management and analysis.
The instruments and analysis tools currently supported by the greater pysat
ecosystem can be found in the :ref:`ecosystem` section.
